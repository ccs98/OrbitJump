## MAIN MECHANIC DEFINITION

Orbit Node should be able to:
- Be Static. Object itself should not be affected by physics
- Contain a collider that is a trigger/sensor. This will be the "orbit" of the node.
- When a player object collides with the "orbit" the player object needs to be pulled into circular motions around the node.
